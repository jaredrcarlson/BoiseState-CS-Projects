# Data Structures
Asymptotic analysis of data structures and algorithms. Efficient algorithms for searching and sorting. Abstract data types including priority queues, maps, search trees, and graphs. Implementation of abstract data types using data structures such as heaps, hash tables, trees, binary search trees, balanced search trees, B-Trees, and representation of graphs. Intro to graph algorithms such as bread-first search, and depth-first search. Continued use of good software engineering practices such as unit testing, automated testing, agile development, version control, and data persistence.
