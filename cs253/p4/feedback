Hey Jared, 

Awesome -> "...have always wondered what these commands actually do..."

Good README. For you last few assignments remember that you DONT have to write a lot to get a 100% on these sections, for instance the following is a concise example that I would give full credit for the discussion section:

BUG #1 DISCOVERED:      gcc hello.c hello -o
THE ISSUE:              incorrect ordering of gcc options, -o needs to be before the object file it re-names
MY SOLUTION:            gcc hello.c -o hello

BUG #2 DISCOVERED:
...
...


A minor bug exists in your Makefile.
BUG: 			SRC=main.c
				...
				hello: $(SRC)
ISSUE:			Target should not be dependant on main.c, should be dependent on main.o
SOLUTION:		SRC=main.o


Cheers,
-Joey.
